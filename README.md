To use the application, create an Excel file with 60 credit entries. The Excel sheet should be aligned from left to right, with the data positioned in rows 2-61 (row 1 should contain the header "charges").

Run the Python code, and when prompted, input the path of the Excel file containing the data (without quotation marks - `“ ”`).

Ensure that the computer running the application has Python installed with the following libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Math, and Openpyxl.
